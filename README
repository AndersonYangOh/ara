ARA's goal is to create simple but convenient solution for managing
the FreeRADIUS server. ARA is PHP web-app operating on FreeRADIUS storage
(currently only MySQL database).

Look here: http://projects.asn.pl/ara and decide is it right tool for you.

This project is still not very mature. Despite this it may be very usable,
but keep in mind that it still needs usage proofs to be considered reliable.

ARA has been written for our internal purposes, but with goal of public usage
and development. Do not fear of correcting/advising us. Your (reasonable :P)
feedback will always be appreciated. At the moment we are even looking for
people interested in taking part in development of this project. If you're a
PHP/FreeRADIUS hacker - don't hesitate and contact us.

For installation notes read the INSTALL file.
